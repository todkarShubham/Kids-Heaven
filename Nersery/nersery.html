                        Kids Heaven is a community-based education centre located in the beautiful bushland
                        setting of Tumbi <br><br>

                        Our experienced and highly qualified educators give children the tools they need to develop
                        lifelong
                        skills and opportunities they need to explore, discover, learn and play—all in a safe and
                        nurturing
                        atmosphere. The children experience unique learning environments, such as a wonderful sensory
                        garden
                        and timber fort, which are designed to stimulate the senses and challenge their growing <br><br>

                        For over 40 years, our preschool has encouraged and facilitated children to develop a love for
                        learning and to prepare them for the transition to primary school and lifelong learning. Our
                        preschool places a strong focus on engaging educational activities and connecting the children
                        with
                        the natural environment.

                        We believe that learning by doing is a great way to teach children the fundamentals they need to
                        start their education and excitement for learning. <br><br>
